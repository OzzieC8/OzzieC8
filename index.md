### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 1 was a favorite because I programmed a pizza unit price 
    calculator. I got to choose how many inches and how much my price 
    would be for the pizza and it would determine how much money that
    pizza would be worth in square inches. This program helped me 
    learn to program multiple features into creating one result 
    specifically for data.
    
* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2 was a favorite because I programmed a calculator
    that made averages of whatever numbers we put into the command line
    and I liked it because I had to put error handling for when there 
    was not enough or no numbers at all, if there was a negative number,
    and even took numbers with decimals. This program helped me 
    understand how a simple program could be so advamced by doing 
    multiple things at once.
    
* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 1 was a favorite because I made a program that 
    searched through a random list of words in english and printed it
    out on the terminal. I liked how I had to program a search program
    and I learned how you can scrape through files to find words.
